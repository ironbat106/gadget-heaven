## Project Overview
Gadget Heaven is built with React, leveraging various fundamental concepts and tools to provide a seamless shopping experience for users. The project is structured to offer a user-friendly interface with well-organized code for maintainability and scalability.

## React Fundamentals Used

- **Components**: Each part of the UI is organized into reusable and modular components.
- **React Router**: Used to create a multi-page app experience, handling routes for Home, Statistics, Dashboard, and Support pages.
- **Conditional Rendering**: Enables different views based on user actions and the current state (e.g., toggling between Cart and Wish list).
- **State Management with Hooks**: `useState` and `useEffect` hooks are used extensively for managing and updating component states.
- **Dynamic Titles with `useEffect`**: Each page dynamically updates the browser title to enhance user experience and SEO.

## Data Handling and Management

- **Local Storage**: Used to store and persist cart and wish list data, allowing users to retain their selected items even after refreshing or revisiting the website.
